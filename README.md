Makes Monarch [Conduit-trailer accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIIwKpH9IHM).

1. Rearm no longer resets cooldowns, instead has instant charge and leaps a large distance.
2. Rocket Salvo/MTMS have 2x damage and blast radius but fire 0.67x missiles and have 1.33x longer cooldowns.
3. Has Energy Transfer by default. (Taking it as first core does nothing)
